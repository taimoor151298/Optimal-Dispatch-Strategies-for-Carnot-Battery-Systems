# Optimal Dispatch Strategies for Carnot Battery Systems

## Setup
- Only download the excel files alongwith `yearly_dispatcher.py`, `weekly_dispatcher.py` and `KPI_calculator.py`
- Place the .csv files in the same folder as the python scripts
- Libraries required: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `cvxpy` and `gurobi solver`
- `yearly_dispatcher.py` is the main file and should be run to solve the optimization problem
- `KPI_calculator.py` calculates the Key Performance Indicators once the dispatch problem is solved
